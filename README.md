# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from an online retail company to uncover valuable insights for business decision-making. The primary goal is to explore customer behavior, identify sales trends, and highlight popular products. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, the project provides actionable recommendations to optimize inventory, enhance marketing strategies, and support market expansion efforts.

The **Online Retail Dataset** is a collection of transactional data from an online retail store. It contains detailed information about sales transactions, including customer purchases, product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. This dataset is typically used for analyzing sales trends, and customer behavior, and identifying popular products, among other insights.

1. **InvoiceNo**: Unique identifier for each transaction or invoice.
2. **StockCode**: Product identifier for each item in the transaction.
3. **Description**: Description of the product purchased.
4. **Quantity**: Number of items purchased in the transaction.
5. **InvoiceDate**: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
6. **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
